1. You both did a great job on this weather app!

2. In the future, I’d recommend searching for better APIs. You used several APIs for cities, coordinates, temperature, and added the icons, comments, and countries manually. However, the other group working on a weather app found an API that provides all of those details in one request — by entering the city in the URL, it gives an object with everything you need.

3. It’s great that you comment on every step in your code. This really helps people like me, who need to read your code from scratch, to understand it better and faster.

4. Your use of JWT looks good, and I can tell you understand the concept well. However, there are still some things you’ll need to grasp, like the refresh token, which you’ll learn about in class in the next few weeks.

5. In conclusion, your code looks great — it’s clean and readable, which is a big plus for a developer!
